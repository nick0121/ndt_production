            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <p>New Dimension Towers Offers Custom, Universal, and Hybrid Wakeboard Towers Nationwide. New Dimension Towers is totally committed to serving the wakeboarding industry by building some of the finest towers found anywhere in the world.</p>
            <h3>Where we've been</h3>
            <p>Our founder, Wayne Hartford, has been in the tower business for many years designing and building towers for boat manufacturers such as Mastercraft, Moomba, Supra, Sea Ray and many others. As a matter of fact, Wayne was the first to design a tower with rails that followed the contour of the windshield, giving it a “wrap around” effect. His innovation, evident on the Mastercraft Zero Flex Flyer tower, still leaves the competition scratching their heads. Wayne’s philosophy is that a tower should enhance the beauty and style of the boat rather than hinder it with a poorly fitted product. After operating a successful OEM tower business for several years, Wayne sold his company and turned his attention to the aftermarket industry. He discovered that there was a great need for exact-fit OEM style towers for older boats. When the OEM tower business started in 1998, older boats were not supported, leaving these boat owners without options for factory-fit towers. The only alternative was to buy a “universal-fit” or so-called “custom-fit” tower where the boat owner provides critical dimensions. That’s like letting your barber perform heart surgery; no thanks! Wayne’s solution was to take each boat on an individual basis and actually design each tower to fit the lines and style of the boat. The mounting system is engineered for structural integrity giving it the look and strength of an OEM product. The end result of these efforts is a tower that is easy to install because it actually fits your deck. It is also pleasing to the eye and safe for you and your family to enjoy for many years.</p>
            <p>As you can imagine, this has been a painstaking, labor-intensive process that has taken several years to accomplish. In fact, it is an ongoing process as New Dimension Towers continually adds more boats to their line-up. Our goal is to give you, the customer, the finest product available at a price you can live with. We guarantee, in writing, that if you are not completely satisfied, we will give you your money back. Now that’s something to get up in the air about!</p>
